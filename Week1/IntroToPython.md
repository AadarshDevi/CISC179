## Questions
1. Create a two-column table; the first column stores the number of languages, and the second column stores the type of language (compiled, interpreted, or both).
2. Discuss the real-world example where Python performance is superior to compiled languages such as C++. To answer this question, you need to do some research.
3. Take a screenshot that shows that Python3 is installed successfully on your PC. The screenshot should show the installed Python version.
4. Take a screenshot that shows that the Github repository is all set up for this course.

## Answers
1. Table of... I did not understand this question.

2. A real world exmple for where python is superior to compiled languages like C++, C:
  1. Prototyping: Python's syntax is closer to english making it easier and faster to make prototypes to see if they work. In compiled languages, there would be more work to be done like memeory management, importing libraries, etc.
  2. Simplicity: When sharing C/C++ code, there are not many people who will understand it. When sharing Python code, more people, non-programmers included have the ability to understand the code.
