# W1 Discussion: Introduction to Python (Graded)

## Questions
**a.** Based on your reading, which statement surprised you?

**b.** Which part of Python language you liked the most?

**c.** Many sources assert that Python is the leading programming language globally, while others suggest it holds the second or third position. Given your research, how would you rate Python, and what are the reasons behind your assessment?

## Answers
**a.** From the reading, not much was surprising to me except that the main python is CPython, which is the official python type.

**b.** In Python, I can write 1 line of code to get input and print it. In Java, C++ it takes more lines to do the same thing.

**c.** I have been in an ecosystem of Java (Native Desktop Apps) and C++ (Arduino) so being able to do the same thing with less lines of code is amazing. I would put it as: Java > C++ > Python. Python can be used to write robots, make apps, games, but most of all, it is one of the best tools for Data Analysis and AI. Java and C++ are my native languages more than python, but Python will be very important as it is still evolving and getting faster. One day, it can do everything.
