## Code

### 1a: multiple print()

print("And one man in his time plays many parts,")
print("His acts being seven ages.")
```

### 1b: single print()
```python
print("All the world's a stage, \n" +
"And all the men and women merely players: \n" +
"They have their exits and their entrances; \n" +
"And one man in his time plays many parts,\n" +
"His acts being seven ages.")
```

### 1d: No Coding
Without, the o/p will be: 127.0.0.1 because I think sep="." means the values are separated by "." instead of " ".

### 1d: Flushing
1. A situation where `flush=True` would work is when, we are debugging a program. It can help find bugs or dsign flaws.
2. A situation where `flush=False` would work is when we just want to get the output after all the process. calculations are done.
