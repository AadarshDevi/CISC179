## Code

### 1a: multiple print()
```python
print("All the world's a stage, ")
print("And all the men and women merely players: ")
print("They have their exits and their entrances; ")
print("And one man in his time plays many parts,")
print("His acts being seven ages.")
```

### 1b: single print()
```python
print("All the world's a stage, \n" +
"And all the men and women merely players: \n" +
"They have their exits and their entrances; \n" +
"And one man in his time plays many parts,\n" +
"His acts being seven ages.")
```

### 1c: No Coding
Without, the o/p will be: 127.0.0.1 because I think sep="." means the values are separated by "." instead of " ".

### 1d: Flushing
1. A situation where `flush=True` would work is when, we are debugging a program. It can help find bugs or dsign flaws.
2. A situation where `flush=False` would work is when we just want to get the output after all the process. calculations are done.

### 1e: Flushingwhen flush=False
When any of the ***objects** have the '\n' new line escape sequence, the buffer will be fushed. If end="\n" and/or any *objects have "\n" the the buffer will act like flush="True".

## What to Submit
1. Python File(s): [Python File](Printing.py)
2. Drawio Flowchart: [Draw.io Flowchart](Lab_2a_flowchart.drawio)
3. Flowchart as Image: [Draw.io Image](Lab_2a_flowchart_image.png)
4. Challenges:
    1. Trying to understand something like print() has so much versitility.
    2. Lot of experimenting needed to understand what this simepple method did.
