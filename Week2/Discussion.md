# W2 Discussion - Data types

## Question
Assume that you have a very large integer (100 digits long). Which is a suitable data type to store such a number
and why?

## Answer
By looking at the data types, we have:
```python
str
int
float
bool
```

Since it has 100 digits, if it is an integer, then datatype will be `int`. But of the number has decimal
places, then it will be stored in `float`.
